# Ghoul NASM

You might have heard about Tokyo ghouls, but have ever you heard of... Assembly ghouls?

## Compile

Clone and run `make`

## Execute

Clone (and maybe compile) and run `./ghoul`

## Why

Initially created on iSH on iPhone, I just wanted to verify that I can normally run my x86 Assembly there
